     XWPE can be used with or without the programming  interface.
     It has its own X interface but can be used also on a charac-
     ter terminal.  xwpe fires up the X interface  together  with
     the  programming interface. xwe is the X version but without
     the special features of the programming interface.  In  con-
     nection  with a simple character terminal you can use wpe to
     programme and we as editor.

     What is xwpe ?

     xwpe is a X-window programming environment designed for use
     on UNIX-systems. It is similar to 'Borland C++ or Turbo Pas-
     cal' environments. The  differences between the  programming
     environments from  Borland and  xwpe is  that many compilers
     and linkers  may  be  started.  From a menu three  different
     debuggers  can be chosen. And of course not only key strokes
     can select these options you can also use a mouse.

     Errors that occur while compiling and linking  a program can
     be examined  in the  sources:  The cursor  will  jump to the
     corresponding line in the source-file. Programs using more
     than  one  source-file  can  be  managed  with the so called
     project-option (see also project-file).  The  programme  can
     be  started  from  within  the  Programming-Environment  and
     errors   may   be    found    using    a    debugger.    The 
     debugging-environment  allows  the  user  to set  and  unset 
     breakpoints directly in the source  code.  The  contents  of  
     variables  may  be  displayed  in  a  special  window,   the 
     Watch-Window.  This  window  is  updated  while  reaching  a  
     breakpoint.  The  Stack-Window displays the programme stack.

     Help is available for xwpe and the  man-pages  installed  on
     the system may be displayed. All this can be reached via the
     help-functions.

     The editor may be used to edit up to 35 files  at  the  same
     time.   They  are  all displayed in a window of their own. A
     mouse is used to select special editor function from the top
     menu.  These  function  can  also  be  selected by hitting a 
     special key or combinations of keys. Some of these  features
     are a  complete  search  and  replace  function (yes, it can 
     search for regular  expressions)  and  a  file-manager.  The
     file-manager  is  used  to  open,  copy,  rename and move or
     delete files.

     The X-window programming environment can be used without the
     special  programming  features.  If  it  is invoked as `xwe'
     (`we' if used with a character terminal) it can be used as a
     editor e.g. for shell-programming.

    The command-line

          xwpe [ options ] file ...
           xwe [ options ] file ...
           wpe [ options ] file ...
            we [ options ] file ...

       The possible options are:

       -pm    The next file is a message-file.

       -r     Start  xwpe  in  the  recover  mode.  The  internal
              buffers  are saved in files with the postfix `.ESV'
              in the name if a signal is caught by xwpe  (except
              for  SIGKILL).   If  the editor is invoked with the
              `-r' option is specified in the command  line,  the
              old session will be recovered.

       -sf file
              file  will  be  used instead of the personal option
              file, $HOME/.xwpe/xwperc.

       -so    The default options are used. The option file  will
              not be read.

       The   following   standard  X  command  line  options  are
       available for the X-Window versions.

       -display display
              This option specifies the X server to contact;  see
              X(1).

       -font font, -fn font
              The font to used for the text can be specified with
              this option.  The default is 8x13.

       -geometry geometry, -g geometry
              This option specifies the  preferred  size  and  and
              position of the editor; see X(1).

       -iconic
              This indicates that xwpe should ask the window man-
              ager to start as icon rather than a normal  window.

       -pcmap This starts xwpe with a private colormap.

 
 
     The initialization files

     On  startup  (subject  to  the  -sf and -so options), xwpe
     reads the personal initialization file $HOME/.xwpe/xwperc.
     If  no  such  file  exists, the system wide initialization
     file, /usr/local/lib/xwpe/xwperc,  is  read.   If  neither
     file exists, the default options will be used.

     xwperc  is a text file written by the programming environ-
     ment.  Although modification by hand is possible  comments
     will be erased if the options are latter saved from within
     xwpe.


     X-Resources:

     The following resources  are  available.  The  application
     name is either "xwe" or "xwpe".  Both belong to the "Xwpe"
     class.

     font (class Font)
            Specifies the name of the font to use.  The default
            is ``8x13.''

     geometry (class Geometry)
            Specifies  the  preferred  size and position of the
            editor.  Sizes of less than 80 x 25 are ignored.

     color1 (class Color1)

     ...

     color16 (class Color16)
            xwpe uses 16 colors. The default setting is similar
            to the PC-color set.

     Only those files which were never  compiled  or  which  have
     been changed since the last time they were compiled are com-
     piled (and linked). Changes in  'include'd  files  are  only
     considered for C-programs.

     Error  in  compilation  and  linking  are  listed   in   the
     Message-Window.  These  errors stop the creating process and 
     the file that contains the error will be opened and the cur-
     sor  will be set in the corresponding line.

     Programming C

     For all C-  and  C++-programs  there  are  some  utilities
     installed to aid the programmer:

     Show Definition (^O S):
     Jump to the definition of a C-expression:  The file contain-
     ing  the definition of the entered expression will be put in
     the foreground and the cursor jumps to the definition  which
     will  be  highlighted.  Structs,  unions, classes, typedefs,
     preprocessor definitions, extern variables and functions can
     be searched.  If a project is defined all files belonging to
     it will be scanned for the definition. Also  all  #include'd
     files  are  scanned recursively as long as they can be found
     in the System-Include-Path defined in Options/Programming.

     If the name is used more than one time in definitions  (e.g.
     as name of a struct and as name of an external variable) the
     next definition may be found with ^O N  (Show  next  Defini-
     tion).

     Matching Bracket (^O  K):
     If the cursor is above a bracket the corresponding closing /
     opening  bracket  is searched and the cursor is moved to it.
     Otherwise the cursor is moved to the next  opening  bracket.
     The  following  pairs of brackets are recognized: {}, [] and
     ().

     Beautify (^O B):
     As C is a block-oriented language all  blocks  are  indented
     equal.  The  depth of the intention depends on the degree of
     the blocking-depth.




     The project-file

     The project-file allows to  compile  and  create  programmes
     containing  more than on module. It is created from the menu
     Project/Options (see also Project-Options) or directly  with
     an editor. The syntax corresponds to that of a Makefile (for
     version 1.1.0 and  above  only).   In  a  project-file  only
     definitions of variables and install-targets are recognized.
     The definition of variables is used like this:

          name = string

     The number of variables is not limited. They are accessed by
     writing  $(name). If a variable is named like an environment
     variable than this environment variable is used. If a  vari-
     able is not defined an empty string is inserted.

     The following variables are predefined:

     FILES
          The names of modules being compiled and linked together
          to create the executable file.

     CMP  Compiler-Path

     CMPFLAGS
          Compiler-Options

     CMPSWTCH
          How are mistakes interpreted? ('GNU'(Default)/'other')

     LDFLAGS
          Loader-Options

     EXENAME
          The name of the Executables (Default: a.out)

     LIBNAME
          The filename used for a library. This library will hold
          all object-files belonging to the project. This library
          is used automatically for linking.
          
     A makefile can be transformed to a project-file very  simple
     by adding the following lines to it (C-code):

               FILES=$(CFILES)
               CMP=$(CC)
               LDFLAGS=$(LIBFLAGS)
               EXENAME='Targetname'

     How Compile and Make work:

     The files are translated in the order given  in  the  FILES-
     variable. If a source has changed after the last translation
     then it is translated again else the next source  is  taken.
     An  error  occurring  while  making  stops  the  work and is
     displayed in the Message-Window.

     If no error occurs then all object-files are linked together
     to an executable named $(EXENAME).

     The project-file can contain an 'install'-target. The  first
     line of this target is

               install: dependencies

     The dependencies are ignored because they have to be entered
     into  the  FILES-variable. All following lines starting with
     <TAB> are interpreted as  UNIX-commands  and  are  executed.
     These line may contain variables defined above:

               <TAB> Command1
               <TAB> Command2

     Command can be every UNIX-command (only  'cd'  is  not  exe-
     cuted).  The  'install'-target  is  started  from  the  menu
     Run/Install or Alt-L (see Run-Menu).


     The Message-String:

     The Message-String defines how warnings  and  error-messages
     produced  by  a  compilation  should  be  interpreted if the
     Compiler-Style 'Other' was selected. It has  to  be  changed
     for each compiler and work like this.

     character, '[a-z]' matches one character  in  the  range  of
     "a..z". (This was described in the section File-Manager.)

     ${FILE}
          is like '*' but the characters are stored  as  name  of
          the file containing the error.

     ${LINE[+-N]}
          is like '*' but the  characters  are  stored  as  line-
          number  containing  the  error.  An  integer  N  can be
          added/subtracted to the line-number.

     The message-string has to contain both ${FILE} and  ${LINE}.
     If a line of output can be interpreted so that it contains a
     valid filename and a valid line number it is used as  error-
     output.

     Also the column number can be used to  interpret  an  error-
     containing line.

     ${COLUMN[+-N]}
          With ${COLUMN} being used as number.

     ${COLUMN=BEFORE[+-N]}
          The string ${COLUMN} is the expression  to  search  for
          and the column is Before the string found.

     ${COLUMN=AFTER[+-N]}
          The string ${COLUMN} is the expression  to  search  for
          and the column is after the string found.

     An integer N can be added/subtracted to the column-number.

     If a message is written in more than one row (e.g. Sun- Pas-
     cal:  pc) the message-string must use "\n" to divide
     the string into different rows.  ${COLUMN=PREVIOUS?STR[+-N]}
     is compared against the ${CMPSTR}-string containing a string
     to compare with.

     Warnings:
          A warning is detected by comparison with a  string  STR
          like  this:  ${?N:STR}  -  N  can be a number or a '*'-
          character. If N is a number then N is  then  number  of
          the  column where the warning begins. Otherwise if N is
          '*' then STR can begin at every position in  the  text.
          More than one warning-message can be defined.

     Some examples:

          gcc: ${?*:warning:}${FILE}:${LINE}:* before \
                                         `${COLUMN=BEFORE}'

          cc(Sun): ${?*:warning:}"${FILE}", line ${LINE}:* \
                                  at or near * "${COLUMN=AFTER}"

          cc(HP): ${?*:warning:}cc: "${FILE}", line ${LINE}:* \
                                   at or near * "${COLUMN=AFTER}"

          pc(Sun): ${?0:e}${?0:w}${?0:s}*:*:* * ${FILE}:\n\n* \
                ${LINE}  ${CMPTXT}^M*-------${COLUMN=PREVIOUS?^}


       Syntax-Support:

       Xwpe supports the syntax of a language by using  different
       colors  to display keywords, constants, preprocessor, com-
       ments, operators and everything  else.   This  support  is
       defined  already for the programming languages C, C++, and
       FORTRAN. More languages can be added to the user's  syntax
       definition  file,  $HOME/.xwpe/syntax_def.   The syntax of
       any predefined language can also be overiden.  If no  per-
       sonal syntax definition file exists, the system definition
       file, /usr/local/lib/xwpe/syntax_def, will be used.

       Each syntax highlighting  is  distinguished  by  the  file
       extension.   The  syntax_def uses the following format for
       language definition.

            "string:  The postfix for the filename."
            "integer: The number of keywords."
            "strings: The keywords."
            "integer: Number of operators with more than one
                      character length."
            "strings: Operators with more than one character
                      length."
            "string:  Operators containing one character."
            "string:  Beginning of comment"
            "string:  End of comment"
            "string:  Beginning of comment reaching until the end
                      of the line."
            "string:  Characters used for comments depending on the
                      column."
            "string:  Special single characters."
            "integer: Column for comments (-1 for none)."
            "integer: Column for continuing line (-1 for none)"
            "Integer: Column for comment till the end of line (1000
                      for none)"

       Strings and integers are separated by blanks  or  carriage
       returns.  The  strings used for single character operators
       and for column depending comments must not contain blanks.
       All strings used for comments can contain NULL to indicate
       that there is no such comment. An integer can be  zero  if
       there  is  no keyword or multiple character operator.  The
       string for special single characters contains the  follow-
       ing fields:

            Character for string-constants
            Character for character-constants
            Character for preprocessor-commands
            Character for quoting the next character
            Character for next line is continuing line
                      (if it is the last character in the line)
            Character (if not empty: the language is not
                       case sensitive)

       If  one character is not defined (e.g. missing) a blank is
       inserted at the corresponding position.

     An example:

           .c
           32
           auto break case char const continue default do
           double else enum extern float for goto if int

     Automatic Indentation

     The behavior of the auto-intention can be  selected  in  the
     Editor-Options-menu.  The following keys are defined:

     <Return>
          The next (new) line is indented to the beginning of the
          previous line.

     <Tab>
          If <Tab> is entered in front of the first visible char-
          acter the whole line is indented like the previous one.
          If the cursor is placed behind  this  column  then  the
          line is indented N characters more than the previous. N
          is the number entered for  the  Tabstops  in  the  menu
          editor-options.  If  the  cursor  is placed behind this
          position or  between  visible  characters  a  <Tab>  is
          inserted.

     <Backspace>
          If entered in front of the first visible character of a
          line  the  line  is  indented  like  the last line that
          started in front of this cursor- position.

     The GNU General Public License
     Version 2, June 1991

     Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
                           675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies 
     of  this  license  document, but changing it is not allowed.

     Preamble

     The licenses for most software are  designed  to  take  away
     your  freedom  to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU
     General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom
     to share and change free software--to make sure the software
     is free for all its  users.   This  General  Public  License
     applies  to  most of the Free Software Foundation's software
     and to any other program whose authors commit to  using  it.
     (Some  other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
     the GNU Library General Public License  instead.)   You  can
     apply it to your programs, too.

     When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom,
     not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make
     sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of  free
     software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you
     receive source code or can get it if you want it,  that  you
     can change the software or use pieces of it in new free pro-
     grams; and that you know you can do these things.

     To protect your rights, we need to  make  restrictions  that
     forbid  anyone  to  deny  you  these rights or to ask you to
     surrender the rights.  These restrictions translate to  cer-
     tain  responsibilities  for  you if you distribute copies of
     the software, or if you modify it.

     For example, if you distribute copies  of  such  a  program,
     whether  gratis  or  for a fee, you must give the recipients
     all the rights that you have.  You must make sure that they,
     too,  receive or can get the source code.  And you must show
     them these terms so they know their rights.

     We protect your rights with two  steps:  (1)  copyright  the
     software,  and  (2)  offer  you this license which gives you
     legal permission  to  copy,  distribute  and/or  modify  the
     software.

     Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make
     certain  that everyone understands that there is no warranty
     for this free software.  If  the  software  is  modified  by
     someone  else  and passed on, we want its recipients to know
     that what they have is not the original, so that  any  prob-
     lems  introduced  by others will not reflect on the original
     authors' reputations.

     Finally,  any  free  program  is  threatened  constantly  by
     software  patents.   We wish to avoid the danger that redis-
     tributors of a free program will individually obtain  patent
     licenses,  in  effect  making  the  program proprietary.  To
     prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must  be
     licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

     The precise terms and conditions for  copying,  distribution
     and modification follow.

     GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING,
     DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

     0. This License applies to any program or other  work  which
     contains  a  notice placed by the copyright holder saying it
     may be distributed under the terms of  this  General  Public
     License.   The  "Program", below, refers to any such program
     or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either  the
     Program  or any derivative work under copyright law: that is
     to say, a work containing the Program or a  portion  of  it,
     either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into
     another language.   (Hereinafter,  translation  is  included
     without limitation in the term "modification".)  Each licen-
     see is addressed as "you".

     Activities other than copying, distribution and modification
     are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope.
     The act of running the Program is not  restricted,  and  the
     output from the Program is covered only if its contents con-
     stitute a work based on the Program (independent  of  having
     been  made  by  running  the Program).  Whether that is true
     depends on what the Program does.

     1. You may  copy  and  distribute  verbatim  copies  of  the
     Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, pro-
     vided that you conspicuously and  appropriately  publish  on
     each  copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of
     warranty; keep intact all the notices  that  refer  to  this
     License  and  to  the  absence of any warranty; and give any
     other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along
     with the Program.

     You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring  a
     copy,  and  you may at your option offer warranty protection
     in exchange for a fee.

     2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or  any
     portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and
     copy and distribute such modifications  or  work  under  the
     terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of
     these conditions:

          a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent
          notices stating that you changed the files and the date
          of any change.

          b) You must cause any work that you distribute or  pub-
          lish,  that  in whole or in part contains or is derived
          from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as
          a  whole  at  no  charge to all third parties under the
          terms of this License.

          c) If the  modified  program  normally  reads  commands
          interactively when run, you must cause it, when started
          running for such interactive use in the  most  ordinary
          way,  to  print or display an announcement including an
          appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is
          no  warranty  (or  else, saying that you provide a war-
          ranty) and that  users  may  redistribute  the  program
          under  these  conditions,  and  telling the user how to
          view a copy of this License.  (Exception: if  the  Pro-
          gram  itself is interactive but does not normally print
          such an announcement, your work based on the Program is
          not required to print an announcement.)

     These requirements apply to the modified work  as  a  whole.
     If  identifiable  sections of that work are not derived from
     the Program, and can be  reasonably  considered  independent
     and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its
     terms, do not apply to those sections  when  you  distribute
     them  as  separate  works.  But when you distribute the same
     sections as part of a whole which is a  work  based  on  the
     Program,  the distribution of the whole must be on the terms
     of this  License,  whose  permissions  for  other  licensees
     extend  to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part
     regardless of who wrote it.

     Thus, it is not the intent of this section to  claim  rights
     or  contest  your  rights  to  work written entirely by you;
     rather, the intent is to exercise the right to  control  the
     distribution  of derivative or collective works based on the
     Program.

     In addition, mere aggregation of another work not  based  on
     the  Program  with  the Program (or with a work based on the
     Program) on a volume of a  storage  or  distribution  medium
     does  not  bring  the  other  work  under  the scope of this
     License.

     3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work  based
     on  it,  under  Section 2) in object code or executable form
     under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that  you
     also do one of the following:

          a)  Accompany  it  with  the   complete   corresponding
          machine-readable source code, which must be distributed
          under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on  a  medium
          customarily used for software interchange; or,

          b) Accompany it with a  written  offer,  valid  for  at
          least  three  years,  to  give  any  third party, for a
          charge no more than your cost of physically  performing
          source  distribution,  a complete machine-readable copy
          of the corresponding source  code,  to  be  distributed
          under  the  terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
          customarily used for software interchange; or,

          c) Accompany it with the information you received as to
          the  offer  to  distribute  corresponding  source code.
          (This alternative is  allowed  only  for  noncommercial
          distribution  and  only  if you received the program in
          object code or executable form with such an  offer,  in
          accord with Subsection b above.)

     The source code for a work means the preferred form  of  the
     work  for  making  modifications  to  it.  For an executable
     work, complete source code means all the source code for all
     modules  it  contains, plus any associated interface defini-
     tion files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and
     installation  of  the  executable.   However,  as  a special
     exception, the source code distributed need not include any-
     thing  that  is  normally  distributed  (in either source or
     binary form) with the major  components  (compiler,  kernel,
     and  so  on) of the operating system on which the executable
     runs, unless that component itself accompanies  the  execut-
     able.

     If distribution of executable or  object  code  is  made  by
     offering access to copy from a designated place, then offer-
     ing equivalent access to copy the source code from the  same
     place counts as distribution of the source code, even though
     third parties are not compelled to  copy  the  source  along
     with the object code.

     4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or  distribute  the
     Program  except  as  expressly  provided under this License.
     Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distri-
     bute  the  Program is void, and will automatically terminate
     your rights under this License.  However, parties  who  have
     received copies, or rights, from you under this License will
     not have their licenses terminated so long as  such  parties
     remain in full compliance.

     5. You are not required to accept this  License,  since  you
     have  not  signed it.  However, nothing else grants you per-
     mission to modify or distribute the Program or  its  deriva-
     tive  works.   These actions are prohibited by law if you do
     not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or distri-
     buting  the  Program (or any work based on the Program), you
     indicate your acceptance of this License to do so,  and  all
     its  terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modi-
     fying the Program or works based on it.

     6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based
     on  the  Program),  the  recipient  automatically receives a
     license from the original licensor to  copy,  distribute  or
     modify  the  Program  subject to these terms and conditions.
     You may not impose any further  restrictions  on  the  reci-
     pients'  exercise of the rights granted herein.  You are not
     responsible for enforcing compliance  by  third  parties  to
     this License.

     7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of
     patent  infringement or for any other reason (not limited to
     patent issues), conditions are imposed on  you  (whether  by
     court  order,  agreement  or  otherwise) that contradict the
     conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from  the
     conditions  of this License.  If you cannot distribute so as
     to  satisfy  simultaneously  your  obligations  under   this
     License  and  any  other  pertinent  obligations,  then as a
     consequence you may not distribute the Program at all.   For
     example,  if  a patent license would not permit royalty-free
     redistribution of the  Program  by  all  those  who  receive
     copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way
     you could satisfy both it  and  this  License  would  be  to
     refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

     If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforce-
     able  under  any particular circumstance, the balance of the
     section is intended to apply and the section as a  whole  is
     intended to apply in other circumstances.

     It is not the purpose of  this  section  to  induce  you  to
     infringe  any  patents  or other property right claims or to
     contest validity of any such claims; this  section  has  the
     sole  purpose  of  protecting  the  integrity  of  the  free
     software distribution system, which is implemented by public
     license practices.  Many people have made generous contribu-
     tions to the wide range of software distributed through that
     system in reliance on consistent application of that system;
     it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is  wil-
     ling  to  distribute software through any other system and a
     licensee cannot impose that choice.

     This section is intended to make thoroughly  clear  what  is
     believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.

     8. If the distribution and/or use of  the  Program  is  res-
     tricted  in  certain countries either by patents or by copy-
     righted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places
     the Program under this License may add an explicit geograph-
     ical distribution limitation excluding those  countries,  so
     that  distribution  is  permitted only in or among countries
     not thus excluded.  In such case, this License  incorporates
     the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

     9. The Free Software Foundation may publish  revised  and/or
     new  versions  of  the  General  Public License from time to
     time.  Such new versions will be similar in  spirit  to  the
     present  version,  but  may  differ in detail to address new
     problems or concerns.

     Each version is given a distinguishing version  number.   If
     the Program specifies a version number of this License which
     applies to it and "any later version", you have  the  option
     of following the terms and conditions either of that version
     or of any later version published by the Free Software Foun-
     dation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
     this License, you may choose any version ever  published  by
     the Free Software Foundation.

     10. If you wish to incorporate parts  of  the  Program  into
     other  free  programs whose distribution conditions are dif-
     ferent, write to the author  to  ask  for  permission.   For
     software  which  is copyrighted by the Free Software Founda-
     tion, write to the Free Software  Foundation;  we  sometimes
     make  exceptions  for  this.  Our decision will be guided by
     the two goals of preserving the free status of  all  deriva-
     tives  of our free software and of promoting the sharing and
     reuse of software generally.

     NO WARRANTY

     11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS
     NO  WARRANTY  FOR  THE  PROGRAM,  TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
     APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE
     COPYRIGHT  HOLDERS  AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM
     "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,  EITHER  EXPRESSED  OR
     IMPLIED,  INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRAN-
     TIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR  A  PARTICULAR  PUR-
     POSE.   THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF
     THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE  PROGRAM  PROVE  DEFEC-
     TIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR
     OR CORRECTION.

     12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR  AGREED
     TO  IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY
     WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS  PERMITTED
     ABOVE,  BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL,
     SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT  OF
     THE  USE  OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT
     LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR
     LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE
     PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),  EVEN  IF  SUCH
     HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
     SUCH DAMAGES.

     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

     Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

     If you develop a new program, and you want it to be  of  the
     greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve
     this is to make it free software which everyone  can  redis-
     tribute and change under these terms.

     To do so, attach the following notices to the  program.   It
     is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to
     most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and  each
     file should have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer
     to where the full notice is found.


          <one line to give the program's name and a  brief  idea
          of what it does.> 
          Copyright (C) 19yy  <name of author>

          This program is free software; you can redistribute  it
          and/or  modify  it  under  the terms of the GNU General
          Public License as published by the Free Software  Foun-
          dation;  either  version  2 of the License, or (at your
          option) any later version.

          This program is distributed in the hope that it will be
          useful,  but  WITHOUT  ANY  WARRANTY;  without even the
          implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or  FITNESS  FOR  A
          PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU General Public License
          for more details.

          You should have received a copy of the GNU General Pub-
          lic  License  along with this program; if not, write to
          the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 675 Mass Ave,  Cam-
          bridge, MA 02139, USA.


     Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and
     paper mail.

     If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice
     like this when it starts in an interactive mode:


          Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19yy name of
          author
          Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; 
          for details type `show w'.
          This is free software, and you are welcome to
          redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c'
          for details.



     The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should  show
     the  appropriate  parts  of  the General Public License.  Of
     course, the commands you use may be called  something  other
     than  `show w' and `show c'; they could even be mouse-clicks
     or menu items--whatever suits your program.

     You should also get your employer (if you work as a program-
     mer)  or  your school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclai-
     mer" for the program, if necessary.  Here is a sample; alter
     the names:


          Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest 
          in the program
          `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) 
          written by James Hacker.

          <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989

     This General Public License does  not  permit  incorporating
     your  program into proprietary programs.  If your program is
     a subroutine library, you may consider  it  more  useful  to
     permit  linking  proprietary  applications with the library.
     If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library  General
     Public License instead of this License.
